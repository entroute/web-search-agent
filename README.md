# web-search-agent

> Web search for AI agents. No Brave/Serper/Tavily account — pay per search in USDC.

A tiny example that runs a web search via a fulfillment-verified x402 endpoint. [EntRoute](https://entroute.com) picks the best-ranked search provider; [x402](https://x402.org) handles payment.

**Why this exists:** Every web-search API for agents wants a billing relationship. Brave Pro, Serper, Tavily — sign up, get a key, set env vars, hit a limit, upgrade. Pay-per-search lets you skip the whole funnel.

## Quickstart — Claude Code (recommended, zero config)

```bash
claude mcp add entroute -- npx @entroute/mcp-server
```

Then ask Claude: *"Find the latest news on x402"* — it discovers a verified search endpoint, pays in USDC on Base, and returns results. No API keys, no wallet setup, no env vars.

## Use it from your own code

```bash
npm install @entroute/sdk-agent-ts
```

Inspect the top-ranked endpoint:

```ts
import { EntRouteClient } from '@entroute/sdk-agent-ts';

const client = new EntRouteClient({ baseUrl: 'https://api.entroute.com' });
const result = await client.discover({ capability_id: 'web.search' });
console.log(result.ranked_endpoints[0]);
```

To actually call it (and have the SDK handle the x402 *402 → pay → retry* dance), pass a Base wallet via `client.discoverAndCall()`. See the [SDK docs](https://entroute.com/docs/sdk).

## Try the demo

Discovery only — prints the top 3 endpoints with score, latency, success rate, and price. No payment, no wallet needed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/entroute/web-search-agent && cd web-search-agent
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

## Why EntRoute

The only x402 directory that pays real USDC to verify each endpoint actually works. Probes run every 10 minutes; failed endpoints get demoted automatically.

- **MCP server:** [`@entroute/mcp-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@entroute/mcp-server)
- **TypeScript SDK:** [`@entroute/sdk-agent-ts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@entroute/sdk-agent-ts)

[x402](https://x402.org) is the open pay-per-request protocol behind it (Coinbase + Linux Foundation). Server returns 402, client pays in USDC on Base, retries with payment header.
